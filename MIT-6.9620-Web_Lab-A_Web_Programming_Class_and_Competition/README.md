# 6.9620 Web Lab: A Web Programming Class and Competition 2024

At its core, web.lab is a [6-Unit MIT IAP Class](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6e.html#6.9620) which teaches the fundamentals of web development. It lays the foundations for understanding complicated web techologies using the fundamental building blocks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition to learning how to build a website, students enrolled in web.lab may also take part in a competition to win prize money and glory.

## class structure

The structure of web.lab can be split up into three phases.

### Phase 0: Team Selection

During the first week of web.lab students form teams of up to three members. Team members should contribute an appropriate amount to receive individual credit for the course. Students tend to have the most fun and success coming into web.lab with a set team, however this isn't always true. Many great websites come from teams which are formed at the end of lectures. This is also a great way to meet other students at MIT!

### Phase 1: Learning

The learning phase of web.lab lasts for the first two weeks of IAP. During this period staff teach lectures and run workshops every day. By the end, we build a fully-fledged website together with the students in the class. In the first week we walk through the basics of web development: how to program in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, how to launch a backend server using node.js, and how to integrate a database into your web-app using MongoDB. In the second week, we teach more advanced topics and sponsors give cool lectures on how students can utilize industry techniques and technoligies in their project.

### Phase 2: Building

The building phase of web.lab is kicked off with a hackthon on the last day of lecture. From this point onwards we let students be to maximize time available to work on their websites! Staff host many office hours during this period and are constantly answering questions online.
